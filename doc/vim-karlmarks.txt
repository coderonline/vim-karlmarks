*vim-karlmarks*   A Vim teaching plugin to show common marks in signcolumn

==============================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                             *karlmarks*

Install the plugin and have `signcolumn=yes` in your vimrc. The plugin uses
a CursorHold autocmd to dynamically display signs int he signcolumn. If
you ever want to remove this plugin, find this text file in your vim
configuration folder with

    :echo expand("%:p:h:h")

and delete the folder. If you want to copy its name to the clipboard you
can use:

    :let @+=expand("%:p:h:h")

I hope this plugin helped you to memorize more of the default marks which Vim
has to offer.
